Spotify Application

This application consists of a client and webserver that interact with the Spotify API to display and manipulate information on a webpage. The client utilized HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS. The webserver uses Express and JavaScript. Once open, the user can directly look for artists, albums, or tracks and can log into their Spotify account to view some information about themselves. The search function links to custom pages for albums, artists, and tracks, which all have external links to their Spotify components.
